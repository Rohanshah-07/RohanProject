This will be a 2D text version of Minecraft You will need to create an object 
oriented and well thought out game. Your game should include all necessary menus 
and structures to make it a complete program. The basic required game mechanics 
are described below:

Non Block Items: (All inherit from the Item class)
Name				           How to get
Dimond Gems		    Mine diamond ore with pickaxe
Gold Ingot			  Smelt gold Ore in furnace consumes 1 coal per ingot created
Stick				      Drop from leaves or craft from wooden plank
Coal              Mine Coal Ore with a pickaxe
Iron Ingot			  Smelt from Iron Ore consumes 1 coal per ingot created			 
Block of gold 	  Have 9 Gold Ingots 

Tools: (All inherit from the Tool class
Name				      Recepie						              Durability
Furnace 			    8 cobblestone				            unlimited uses
stone pickaxe		  3 cobblestone + 2 sticks	      20 blocks (automatically used only for pickaxe blocks if in inventory)
Iron Pickaxe		  3 Iron Ingot + 2 sticks		      60 blocks (automatically used only for pickaxe blocks if in inventory)
Diamond Pickaxe	  3 Diamond gems + 2 sticks	      unlimited uses

Randomly generates a 5 x 5 grid of random blocks like so: 

  0 1 2 3 4  
a 0 1 2 3 4  
b 0 1 2 3 4  
c 0 1 2 3 4  
d 0 1 2 3 4  
e 0 1 2 3 4  

Each number (other than top row) will be replaced by a random block 
by showing it's element symbol. To mine a block the user will type in the 
letter/number coordinate and hit enter.
 
When you break a block it should be replaced with an air block. 

for example e3 would be a valid coordinate input(similar to the game battleship)

Blocks should spawn according to their spawn chance numbers which are a % chance 
for each block.

Once the user is done mining the specific area they can use the dig command to go 
deeper and generate a new grid of blocks. 

Win Condition:
The user will win the game once they craft 1 block of gold. 

build a menu that takes craft commands in the form: craft item. 
After typing the command the game will tell you if the craft was 
successfull by checking your inventory for the necessary items, 
tools, and/or blocks.
